            I am a fullstack developer. I enjoy both designing websites and working with databases, perhaps one day I will choose a favorite, but not today. I have completed a Fullstack Developer course through the University of Utah with an A+ grade average, and am excited to receive my official Certificate of Completion soon. All of my group projects have garnered class voted awards. I am fully capable of working with HTML, CSS, JS, React, MySql, MongoDB, Node, Express, and more. I have started to study Python, and intend to continue my studies into Java, React Native and Amazon Web Services.
